Some weights of the model checkpoint at AI-Sweden-Models/Llama-3-8B-instruct were not used when initializing LlamaEncoderModel: ['lm_head.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing LlamaEncoderModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing LlamaEncoderModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
/data/users/spreitz/LagRag/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/peft/tuners/tuners_utils.py:196: UserWarning: Already found a `peft_config` attribute in the model. This will lead to having multiple adapters in the model. Make sure to know what you are doing!

The attention layers in this model are transitioning from computing the RoPE embeddings internally through `position_ids` (2D tensor with the indexes of the tokens), to using externally computed `position_embeddings` (Tuple of tensors, containing cos and sin). In v4.45 `position_ids` will be removed and `position_embeddings` will be mandatory.
